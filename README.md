# Localisation Website

This is the final project for the localisation course
## About this website
Welcome to my localisation website. Here you will find a summary of the contents seen during the localisation course and a few lines about my personal learning experience.
## About me
My name is Jesús Bermúdez and I am Mexican. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in [Multilingual Communication Technology](https://www.unige.ch/fti/en/enseignements/ma-tim/) at the **University of Geneva**. My main interests are programming and languages; however, I am not a devotee of translation.
